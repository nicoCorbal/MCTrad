      "q1": "What is a Sworn Translation?",
      "a1": "A sworn translation is an official translation carried out by a translator appointed by the government (MAEC or German Courts). It bears a seal and signature, giving it legal validity before authorities.",
      "q2": "How long does it take?",
      "a2": "Standard documents (e.g., birth certificates) are usually processed within 24-48 hours. Postal delivery from Spain to Germany takes approx. 3-5 days.",
      "q3": "Do you need the original document?",
      "a3": "In most cases, a high-quality scan is sufficient. The translation will certify that it is a 'translation of a copy/scan'. This is accepted in 99% of cases (please verify with your authority).",
      "q4": "Is the translation valid in Germany?",
      "a4": "Yes. As a translator authorized by the Higher Regional Court of Cologne (OLG Köln), my translations are officially recognized by German authorities.",
      "q5": "How do I pay?",
      "a5": "You will receive an invoice including VAT. Payment is conveniently made via bank transfer."
